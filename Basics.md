### What is Machine Learning?
Machine learning is a subfield of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that allows computers to learn from data without explicit programming.  Instead of writing out every instruction, machines can improve at a specific task by analyzing data. This data can be used to predict future values, classify information, or find hidden patterns.

#### Common Terms in Machine Learning**
* **Data** (Input): The raw information used to train a machine learning model. Data can come in many forms like numbers, text, or images.
* **Model:**  The representation of the learned knowledge from the data. This can be a mathematical equation, a computer program, or a set of rules. 
* **Training** (Learning): The process of feeding data to the model and adjusting its internal parameters to improve performance on a specific task. 
* **Prediction** (Output):  The model's output after being trained on data. Predictions can be used for various purposes like forecasting future values or classifying new data points.
* **Features** (Attributes):  The individual attributes or measurements used to describe a data point.  These features are fed into the model to make predictions.
* **Target Variable (Label):**  The value the model is trying to predict. This can be a numerical value or a category label. In essence, it's the **desired outcome** the model is trying to learn and predict based on the features. For example, in an image classification task, the features might be pixel values of an image, and the label could be the category of the object in the image (e.g., cat, dog, car).

#### Commonly Used Machine Learning Algorithms (Basic Definitions)
* **Linear Regression:** This algorithm finds a linear relationship between features and a target variable. It's often used for prediction tasks like forecasting future sales or stock prices.
* **Logistic Regression:** Similar to linear regression, but used for predicting binary outcomes (Yes/No, True/False). 
* **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):** This algorithm classifies data points based on the similarity to their nearest neighbors in the training data.
* **Decision Trees:** This algorithm makes predictions by following a tree-like structure of questions based on the features. It's good for interpretable models where you want to understand the reasoning behind the prediction.
* **Support Vector Machines (SVM):** This algorithm creates a hyperplane that best separates data points of different categories. It's powerful for classification tasks with high-dimensional data.
* **Random Forest:** This ensemble method combines multiple decision trees for improved prediction accuracy and to prevent overfitting the training data.
